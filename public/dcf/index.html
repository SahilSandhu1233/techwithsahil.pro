            <h3>STMP Intro</h3>
            <p> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or in short SMTP is application layer protocol used for 
                transmission of email from client to the mail server, here client is responsible for the 
                initiation and closing of the email and the server are responsible for replying to the clients 
                call (Meaning responsible for answering the command received from client). SMTP is
                used all around the world for sending of email and it has become a crucial part of office 
                life. SMTP standard operating port is port 25. SMTP is a connection-oriented protocol. This
                means that a connection is established between the SMTP server and the SMTP client before 
                any data is transferred. Once the connection is established, the SMTP client can issue 
                commands to the SMTP server, and the SMTP server can respond to those commands. SMTP is 
                a delivery protocol only.

            <h3>STMP Commands</h3>
            <p>The SMTP commands define the mail transfer  system function requested by the 

                user.  SMTP commands are character strings terminated by &lt;CRLF&gt;. The command codes 
                
                themselves are alphabetic characters terminated by &lt;SP&gt; if parameters follow and &lt;CRLF&gt; 
                
                otherwise.  The syntax of mailboxes must conform to receiver site conventions. SMTP uses a 
                
                simple, text-based command set. The most common commands are:<br><br>
                
                HELO: It helps to initiate connection with a SMTP server.<br>
                
                EHLO: It helps making a connection with a SMTP server and to request extended SMTP 
                
                Features.<br>
                
                MAIL FROM: It is used to specify the sender of a message.<br>
                
                DATA: It is used to specify a message body.<br>
                
                RSET: It is used to restart the current session.<br>
                
                VRFY: It verifies and validates the address of a recipient.<br>
                
                RCPT TO: It is used to specify recipient of a message.<br>
                
                EXPN: It can be used for expansion recipient's address.<br>
                
                QUIT: It is used to terminate a connection.<br>
                
                AUTH: It is used in authentication of client to the server<br>
                
                HELP: It is used in SMTP sever to issue a help request.<br><br>
                
                
                SMTP is a message-oriented protocol. It implies that messages are transferred as a sequence 
                
                of lines of text, with each line terminated by a carriage return and a line feed.
                
                The first line of a message is the SMTP command, and the remaining lines are the message 
                
                body. The message body can be any text, including headers, signatures, and so forth.
                
                SMTP uses ASCII character set. Which implies that a character which is outside of ASCII 
                
                range (0-127) must be encoded using a mechanism such as Base64.
                
                SMTP also supports eight-bit character sets, but this is not common.
                
                SMTP is a reliable protocol. This means that messages are transferred using a error-checking 
                
                mechanism, and that messages are not lost or corrupted in transit.
                
                SMTP can be used to send and receive messages in a number of different formats, including:
                
                Plain text like HTML etc.<br><br>
                
                
                The most common format is plain text, which can be read by any email client. HTML and MIME 
                
                are more advanced formats that allow for the sending of attachments and other rich content.
                
                SMTP is a simple protocol, but it is also very flexible. It can be used to send and receive 
                
                messages in a variety of different formats, and it can be extended to support new features and 
                
                capabilities.

            <h3>RFC 821</h3>
            <p>The RFC 821 published to normalize the utilization o f the use of information exchange which  

                on will be known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. The concepts for this protocol 
                
                implementation for any platform is established by this RFC. This model represents the first 
                
                definition of an email transfer over any network. The first point defines that the content to be 
                
                used in the transfer will be composed exclusively of a very specific set called the US-ASCII 
                
                characters.<br><br>
                
                
                There are three moves toward SMTP mail exchanges. The exchange is begun with a MAIL order 
                which gives the shipper recognizable proof. A progression of at least one RCPT orders follows 
                giving the collector data. Then a DATA order gives the mail information. Lastly, the finish of mail 
                information pointer affirms the transaction. The first step in the procedure is the MAIL 
                command. <br><br>
                The command contains the source mailbox. <br><br>
                
                MAIL FROM:<br><br>
                
                This command tells the SMTP-receiver that a new mail transaction is starting and to reset all its 
                
                state tables and buffers, including any recipients or mail data. It gives the reverse-path which 
                
                can be used to report errors. If accepted, the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply. The can 
                
                contain more than just a mailbox. The is a reverse source routing list of hosts and source 
                
                mailbox. The first host in the should be the host sending this command This definition indicates 
                
                that a new mail transfer should begin with the MAIL command used to indicate its origin.

            <h3>RFC 2821</h3>
            <p>In the year 2001, the RFC 2821 obsoletes 821 to neutralize the ascending of email dangers. The
                principal contrasts are portrayed underneath.
                Roughly 10 years in 1990, after RFC821 was finished, the convention was changed with a 
                New model that allows the client and server t consent to use shared 
                usefulness past the first SMTP necessities. The SMTP expansion component characterizes a 
                method by which a lengthy SMTP client and server may perceive one another, and the server 
                can illuminate the client with regards to the help expansions that it upholds. <br><br>
                
                EHLO changes to HELO: <br><br>
                
                Contemporary SMTP executions MUST help the fundamental expansion mechanics. IN this
                case, servers MUST help the EHLO order regardless of whether they carry out a particular
                augmentations and clients SHOULD specially use EHLO instead of HELO. (Nonetheless, for
                similarity with more seasoned adjusting executions, SMTP clients and servers MUST help
                the first HELO systems as a backup plan.) Unless the various qualities of HELO must
                be recognized for interoperability purposes, this report examines just EHLO.

            <h3>Message Format</h3>
            <p>RFC 822 has defined the SMTP email addresses format. The MAPI components handle the address that agree with the norms. However, there is a particular form of RFC 822 address that best encodes MAPI addresses: <br><br>

                display-name&lt;email-address&gt;<br><br>
                
                The angle brackets are included as literals. Blanks are common in display names; they need not be quoted. A typical address might look like this one, which belongs to one of the coauthors of RFC 1521: <br><br>
                
                Nathaniel Borenstein &lt;nsb@bellcore.com&gt; <br><br>
                
                If the display name contains characters that have special meaning in SMTP addresses, such as < or @, the entire display name should be enclosed in double quotes. On outbound mail, if the total length of the email address plus display name exceeds 255 characters, the display name should be dropped.
